# Github Issue Viewer - Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quickstart

- Install dependencies

```shell
$ yarn install
```

- Start the development server

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

You are good to go! The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Testing

To run the tests in the watch mode, run the following command:

```shell
$ yarn test
```

## Building

If you want to build the production version of the app, you can run:

```shell
$ yarn build
```

To run the production version locally, use the following command:

```shell
$ yarn start
```

This will serve the built version of the app with a static server.
